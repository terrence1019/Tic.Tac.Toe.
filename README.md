A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C#

Most people start coding in a new language creating a simple "Hello, World" console application. When it came time for me to learn C#, I wanted to try something more ambitious but also familiar. That's where the idea of a Tic-Tac-Toe game was born.

You learn by building, and this project was a great introduction to C#.
